# ClosedXML.TableReader

ClosedXml is an amazing .NET library to manage Excel files based on [OpenXML Standard](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Open_XML). This component drastically reduces the complexity of working with [Open XML SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30425) 

This library extends ClosedXML to read Excel tables in typed way. You can read all or some columns, apply transformation rules for each field, refer column by title or name using DataAnotations.
